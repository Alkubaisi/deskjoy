      <h1>About us</h1>

      <p> We know how difficult it is to find a home for our companies and how hard it is to build the perfect commuity in our spaces.

        DeskJoy is an online marketplace which seeks to match those looking to rent office space with those who have it.</p>

        <p>We understand that we spend most of our waking hours in our workplaces; they are our “second home” and absolutely critical to our success. It really really annoys us that it’s such a frustrating process to find the perfect office or attract the ideal tenants to your office space.</p>

        <p>We also got thinking about how much empty space there was in the offices all around us. Surely there were people within walking distance who would be willing to rent available desks and surplus space for a reasonable price?</p>

        <p>Our mission is to provide you with the tools you need to find & create the ideal home from which to grow your business, we aim to nurture positive work cultures and build on and develop our communities.</p>
